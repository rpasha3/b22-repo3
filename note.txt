to remote GitHub.com repository
Few things haooened:
1. It automatically created new remote repo 
under your GitHub.com account
2. Made the connection with your local git repo
3. Added all youre commits to remote expo


Now our work will continue locally

1. add a new file called note.txt
2. committed the change to local repo
3. we want this change to be reflected in remote repository so we PUSHED local commits to remote repository using push origin button
4. observe it has been added in your repository under GitHub.com
